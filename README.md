# thermal-conductivity-MgO
data and post-processing code for thermal conductivity of MgO under extreme condition.

we note that, the `comp_dir` in the notebook should be changed to make the program work.

the raw data thermal conducitivty calculated by DPMD are stored in the notebook.

the `compare` directory is used to storage previous experimental or theoretical data for comparison.
